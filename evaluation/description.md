This folder contains plot scripts for EuroSys 2023 paper "FrozenHot Cache: Rethinking Cache Management for Modern Software" figure 8~15, but does not contains experiment data for processing.

Data are required to see in each `origin_data/figureX/` folder. We use figure10 as an example.

Every data processing script is named like "handle_data.py", while every plot script is marked with the corresponding figure name.

Scripts are classified into folders named with corresponding figure.

Figure 10, 14 are two folders without "data_handle.py", cause data used in this script is collected manually.
